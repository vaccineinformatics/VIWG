# VaxInfo Consortium: Bridging Vaccine Research through Collaborative Informatics

Welcome to the official page of the VaxInfo Consortium. As the intersection of medical research and technology becomes increasingly significant, our consortium stands committed to bringing together global vaccine researchers to promote innovation, collaboration, and excellence.

## Overview

In today’s fast-paced world of medical research and technology, the VaxInfo Consortium stands as a beacon for vaccine researchers worldwide. Harnessing the capabilities of biomedical ontologies, knowledge representation, and artificial intelligence, we aim to streamline and elevate the quality of vaccine research and development. Our consortium seeks to unravel the intricate mechanisms behind vaccines, pioneering a new age in vaccine reverse engineering.

## Working Groups

### [Minimal Information Standard Working Group](./miswg)
- Develop the Minimal Information about Vaccine Information Standard (MIVIS).
- Establish vaccine naming conventions.

### [Ontology Working Group](./ontologywg)
- Develop various vaccine-related ontologies such as VO, VIDO, VICO, and OVAE.

### [Vaccine Design Working Group](./vdwg)
- Build gold standard datasets for vaccine design.
- Promote collaborative vaccine design studies.

_For detailed information, visit our [Working Groups page](./working-groups)._
